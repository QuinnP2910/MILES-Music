  review: "<em>Transmission, Flux</em> is one of the first releases in Duster's discography - released in 1997, before their first studio album <em>Stratosphere</em>. It features only five tracks and reveals Duster in an early stage in the development of their sound, though that does not mean this album is not of high quality. In a short time, less than 10 minutes, it is able to convey potent emotion and thoughtfulness.\n\nThe opening track hits you with a wall of distortion as a muddy guitar blares out the lead riff of <a href=\"#1\" class=\"review-link\">\"Orbitron\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"1-review\"\>1</span></a>. This riff is catchy and addicting as much as it is abrasive. The typical vocal style throughout the work of Duster is present on this record as well - quiet, gloomy, and drowned-out. Sparse as well, as this song, in usual Duster fashion, only features a few lines of lyrics. This song serves as a fantastic opener and serves its role of setting the melancholy, slow mood of the album. It features haunting lyrics such as <em>\"You know the clock is ticking down and no one's in control\" and \"I know you're terrified like the rest of us.\"</em>\n\nThe next track here is an instrumental track titled <a href=\"#2\" class=\"review-link\">\"Fuzz and Timbre\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"2-review\"\>2</span></a>. I love this track, as simplistic as it is. The whole track is in reverse and it features these waning notes that feel extremely wistful and melancholic. For an instrumental, it is able to convey such strong emotions. My only complaint is that this track is mixed very low. While listening to this track, it often sounds like there are 35 seconds of silence where this track should be. Otherwise, this is a fantastic instrumental track.\n\n<a href=\"#3\" class=\"review-link\">\"My Friends Are Cosmonauts\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"3-review\"\>3</span></a> features vocals unlike any I've heard from Duster - they make use of what sounds like a talk-box. While I appreciate this vocal experimentation, I don't think it lands for this track. Though, it definitely gives the track a unique and sci-fi-like sound, which builds upon Duster's theme of space and atmosphere. This is definitely not a track that I love off this record, but the artistry and experimentation that went into it making it still makes a quality track.\n\nThe following track is <a href=\"#4\" class=\"review-link\">\"Closer to the Speed of Sound\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"4-review\"\>4</span></a>, which is probably my least favorite song on this record. That being said, it is definitely still well-made and it is certainly not a bad song - personally, the repetitive vocal melodies make this a bit of a hard listen. However, the instrumentation is still on-par with any other Duster song, and this song does not detract from the album in any major way.\n\nThe final track on this album ends it on a very high note. While short and mainly instrumental, <a href=\"#5\" class=\"review-link\">\"Stars Will Fall\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"5-review\"\>5</span></a> features beautiful, mourning, and sorrowful guitar licks. The only words spoken on this track are <em>\"All we know is that stars will fall and holidays come and go.\"</em> Just hearing a few notes of this track pulls at the heartstrings, and the vocals just add another fantastic, dismal layer to the track. This is my favorite track on the album, and one of my favorites in Duster's entire discography.\n\nTo summarize, though this EP is short and has a low point in the form of \"Closer to the Speed of Sound\", it has very high highs with \"Orbitron\" and \"Stars Will Fall\" and a beautiful instrumental. For one of their first pieces of work, this album is very well-made and shows Duster developing their Lo-Fi sound in its earliest days.",

  review: "The <em>MF</em> EP, a collaborative project between frequent collaborators MF DOOM and MF Grimm, came off the heels of DOOM's fantastic <em>Operation: Doomsday</em> in 1999. It is split into 3 songs for DOOM and 4 for Grimm, along with instruments for all 7 tracks for a total of 14 tracks - certainly not a short length for an EP. The album cover is one of DOOM's only to feature himself mask-less, which shows that his identity was still developing at this point.\n\nThe record opens with <a href=\"#1\" class=\"review-link\">\"Doomsday (Remix)\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"1-review\"\>1</span></a>, a remix by Mister Jason of track 2 off of his aforementioned previous record. I'm not sure if it's because I've listened to the original so much, but this beat just doesn't seem to compliment DOOM's style on this track at all. While the beat itself isn't terrible, DOOM's rhymes feel awkward on top of it. I would choose the original ten times out of ten.\n\nThe next track is a much better cut - <a href=\"#2\" class=\"review-link\">\"No Snakes Alive\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"2-review\"\>2</span></a> is a posse cut featuring the Monsta Island Czars, specifically MF Grimm under his Jet Jaguar alias and Rodan along with DOOM himself under his King Geedorah alias. Speaking of which, this track would later go on to appear on King Geedorah's <em>Take Me to Your Leader</em>. I really enjoy the playful, eccentric beat on this track. At the end of his first verse, DOOM (as King Geedorah) begins to rap much faster than he often does as the beat almost struggles to keep up in an impressive display of ability from DOOM as a producer and a rapper. Rodan's verse steals the show here as spits rapidly and relentlessly, leaving no room to breathe in another fantastic show of rapping ability on this track. It is certainly a highlight.\n\nDOOM's final track, also his first original solo track on this EP, <a href=\"#3\" class=\"review-link\">\"Impostas\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"3-review\"\>3</span></a> is a fairly average DOOM track. The production is, as always, eccentric and his rhymes are, as always, charismatic and charming. <em>\"I can tell they see they styles as too tricky and too thicky on this microphone doohickey.\"</em>\n\nAs mentioned before, this record is majority MF Grimm, as he has four solo tracks to himself, one being a remix. The first track on his end is <a href=\"#4\" class=\"review-link\">\"The Original (Remix)\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"4-review\"\>4</span></a>, and the original <a href=\"#7\" class=\"review-link\">\"The Original\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"7-review\"\>7</span></a> appears as well as track 7. I personally prefer the original \"The Original\" slightly more than the remix, though the difference is not massive. MF Grimm is certainly able to hold his own, lyrically, with lines like <em>\"For those who scheme on, Dream On like Brian Benben; master loose-leaf, but rhyme books tight; Not afraid to face death cause I know what he looks like.\"</em> Grimm, as per his name, has a continuous theme of death throughout his track, referencing the Grim Reaper often. This helps make his songs particularly cold and hard-as-nails.\n\nAn unfortunate reality regarding Grimm's side of this project is censorship. All tracks but <a href=\"#5\" class=\"review-link\">\"Break 'Em Off\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"5-review\"\>5</span></a> has expletives silenced. While I completely respect if this was a personal choice, I would be lying if I said it didn't reduce the punch of some of his bars. Speaking of \"Break 'Em Off\", I enjoyed this track - especially the production. The skipping melody adds emphasis to Grimm's rapping style. Like DOOM, Grimm often has a sense of humor in his lyrics, like the line <em>\"Judge acting like I just f----- his wife in his bed and drank his wine and she gave me head, so heâ€™s giving me time.\"</em> Despite this, I don't really find myself coming back to this track as a favorite - it is fairly run-of-the-mill for Grimm.\n\nMy favorite track off Grimm's side, and probably the entire EP, is his song <a href=\"#6\" class=\"review-link\">\"Dedicated\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"6-review\"\>6</span></a>. The beat features a punchy, funky beat with string samples throughout. His lyricism on this track is fantastic, with lyrics like <em>\"I prayed to God as a child, but, as a man, I only pray to die\"</em> and many references to death and legacy, speaking on how <em>\"not even death can separate the love.\"</em> While Grimm sometimes struggles to keep up with DOOM lyrically, on this track, he is toe-to-toe with his collaborator.\n\nThe second half of the EP is a solid addition for those who are interested in the production side of this record. While none of the instrumentals are absolutely incredible, there are a few gems.\n\nTo summarize, while the MF EP is not an outstanding project, it has a few gems. DOOM's side is plagued by the sub-par remix of \"Doomsday,\" though he shines in the posse cut with the Monsta Island Czars on track 2. There's no bad track on Grimm's side with a highlight or two, and the instrumentals on the second half of the track are a good addition. MF DOOM continues to develop his sound on this record as he prepares to drop some of the most influential records of underground hip hop.",

  review: "<em>Contemporary Movement</em> comes a full 2 and a half years after Duster's last full-length studio album, Stratosphere, and indulges in a slightly darker sound. This record served as Duster's last for nearly two decades.\n\nIt opens with the track <a href=\"#1\" class=\"review-link\">\"Get the Dutch\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"1-review\"\>1</span></a>, which sets the tone for the rest of the record. It features Duster's iconic droning drums and guitars, though with a uniquely eerie tone to them - as would be the case for the rest of the record. The haunting line <em>\"we make friends just to turn them into enemies\"</em> closes out this track.\n\n<a href=\"#2\" class=\"review-link\">\"Operations\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"2-review\"\>2</span></a> brings Duster's typical melancholic sound, and every word that is spoken feels powerful. That is a theme constant throughout Duster's discography - they are sparse in their lyrics, giving each line massive potency. \n\nHowever, it is in the mid-section of this record in which it shines the most. The run of songs from tracks 4 through 8 is fantastic, beginning with the phenomenal <a href=\"#4\" class=\"review-link\">\"Me and the Birds\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"4-review\"\>4</span></a>. This track opens with an addicting, screaming guitar riff that never gets old. It feels melancholic and weary, and the lyrics of this song target consumerism and drug culture. The track is short, sitting at about 1:34, though it does what it needs to do and has a way of sticking with you.\n\n<a href=\"#5\" class=\"review-link\">\"Travelogue\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"5-review\"\>5</span></a> is covered with beautiful guitar licks that wander and fade masterfully. Along with that, Duster's lead vocalist makes use of a completely different style on this track. This is because this is one of the very few songs that band member Jason Albertini sings over. Instead of the typically quiet, saddened vocals, he seems to be more despairing. Reverb on his vocals causes his words to blur together in a fog of desperation as he asks <em>\"should I, or should I not?\"</em>\n\n<a href=\"#6\" class=\"review-link\">\"The Phantom Facing Me\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"6-review\"\>6</span></a> finds beautiful vocal melodies that mesh perfectly with the guitar harmonies on this track. Duster continues their more dark theme on this record with the lyrics <em>\"It's falling apart â€¦ I think I'm slipping away.\"</em> He references what seems like death, speaking of a <em>\"cloak outstretched\"</em> and a <em>\"phantom facing me,\"</em> saying that it would not ruin things as he would <em>\"just disappear\"</em>. This is truly an emotional low for the album and Duster's discography as a whole.\n\n<a href=\"#7\" class=\"review-link\">\"Cooking\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"7-review\"\>7</span></a> features another massively catchy guitar riff that feels more upbeat and happy, especially in contrast to the previous track. I could listen to this track for hours - the melodies of the guitar never get old to me. The vocals are strangely clear, as opposed to the often muddled and drowned state they often appear in. Meanwhile, <a href=\"#8\" class=\"review-link\">\"Unrecovery\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"8-review\"\>8</span></a> is absolutely devastating. To me, it is the saddest song on the album. The title refers to falling apart and going backward in progression. The vocalist on this track is again Jason Albertini, and his typical vocal style complements the instrumental perfectly. His vocal inflections on the lines <em>\"he couldn't get up, so he decided to stay\"</em> and <em>\"ready or not, here it comes\"</em> feel decisive and yet deeply saddening. He even peaks the typical Lo-Fi microphone as he sings/shouts <em>\"he was reeling southbound\"</em>. This track is a favorite for me, and, in my opinion, the most devastatingly depressing song the band has released.\n\nThe following track, <a href=\"#9\" class=\"review-link\">\"The Breakup Suite\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"9-review\"\>9</span></a>, is a more lyrical song than many Duster tracks. Instead of a few sparse lines thrown across the track, this has a more constant vocal flow with lines like <em>\"it's a ghost town, dreaming in footprints\"</em> and the pleading <em>\"I wish I was a little bit smarter,\"</em> with a wholly unique vocal inflection.\n\nThe record's final tracks are solid and well-made, but none stand out to me as incredible in their quality aside from the final track. I enjoy the relatively aggressive drumming on <a href=\"#10\" class=\"review-link\">\"Everything You See (Is Your Own)\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"10-review\"\>10</span></a>. The guitar riff on <a href=\"#11\" class=\"review-link\">\"Now It's Coming Back\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"11-review\"\>11</span></a> feels almost like a lullaby, with barely-decipherable lyrics. <a href=\"#12\" class=\"review-link\">\"Auto-Mobile\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"12-review\"\>12</span></a> is a very slow song, with almost jazz-inspired drums and a droning, reverbed guitar. I love the line <em>\"the audience finds their feet, clap and scream, but what does it mean?\"</em> which closes out the record. This final track feels like a late night, with references to an out-of-tune performance as the stars come out, whispering <em>\"come to me.\"</em>\n\nTo conclude, this record is a fantastic addition to the Duster discography. It is desperate, despairing, and depressing. Even its few happy moments are drenched in melancholy. It has some of Duster's best work, with only a few songs that don't fully land. There is no song on here that I don't enjoy, and there are a few that I find to be masterpieces. This is a fantastic record, and one I have very few complaints about.\n",

  review: "Daniel Dumile makes his debut under his MF DOOM alias in this lovably rough \"origin story\" of a record.\n\nHe makes use of snippets from the 1982 film Wild Style and the 1967-68 Fantastic Four TV Show to juxtapose his past as a member of a graffiti crew turned rap trio KMD and his future as the super-villain MF DOOM. These skits cover topics like isolationism, publicity, and self-destruction. They fail to create an overarching coherent \"story\" to the album, though they do still add playful interludes that reveal segments of DOOM's backstory, including the reason he wears his iconic mask. The most impactful of these skits is <a href=\"#19\" class=\"review-link\">\"Hero v.s. Villain (Epilogue)\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"19-review\"\>19</span></a>, in which the listener is challenged to draw the line between good and evil to determine whether MF DOOM is truly the villain he presents himself as.\n\nAs for the actual songs on this record, DOOM never fails to impress with his ability to produce punchy and unconventional beats. His use of samples and collaborators is almost always done masterfully. In the opening track, <a href=\"#2\" class=\"review-link\">\"Doomsday\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"2-review\"\>2</span></a>, the inclusion of vocalist Pebbles The Invisible Girl creates infectious hooks - not to mention the rapid-fire, charismatic rhymes on this track. Another catchy track comes in the form of <a href=\"#3\" class=\"review-link\">\"Rhymes Like Dimes\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"3-review\"\>3</span></a>, with an outro from DJ Cucumber Slice that never fails to make me grin.\n\n<a href=\"#4\" class=\"review-link\">\"The Finest\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"4-review\"\>4</span></a> sees a smooth, funk-inspired beat with solid performances in this first collaboration between MF DOOM and Tommy Gunn, though the latter leaves a bit to be desired. <a href=\"#6\" class=\"review-link\">\"Go with the Flow\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"6-review\"\>6</span></a> sees DOOM spitting over an infectious, descending beat in another great cut.\n\nTrack 7, <a href=\"#7\" class=\"review-link\">\"Tick, Tick...\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"7-review\"\>7</span></a> is my least favorite song on this record. The constant tempo changes and dream-like instrumental makes this a hard listen, and the sub-par rhymes on top of it are not enough to save it. While I appreciate the experimentation that went into this track, the end product is a song I will often skip.\n\n<a href=\"#8\" class=\"review-link\">\"Red and Gold\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"8-review\"\>8</span></a> brings the energy back up in with a staccato, disco-like beat that I enjoy thoroughly. <a href=\"#10\" class=\"review-link\">\"Who You Think I Am?\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"10-review\"\>10</span></a> is a massive collaboration track between many of the Monsta Island Czars. This track is fine - the instrumental isn't anything special, and many of his collaborators pale in comparison to DOOM's ability.\n\n<a href=\"#12\" class=\"review-link\">\"Hey!\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"12-review\"\>12</span></a> serves as one of, if not my favorite track on this record. This track truly shines in its production - it is truly the theme song of a supervillain, and its horns are unbelievably potent. DOOM is at his most evil in this track, and his production here is a highlight.\n\nThe production in <a href=\"#13\" class=\"review-link\">\"Operation: Greenbacks\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"13-review\"\>13</span></a> is stunning as well, though aspects of it tend to drone on and make this track slightly less listenable - namely, its vocal samples. Tommy Gunn doesn't help this with an underwhelming verse. <a href=\"#14\" class=\"review-link\">\"The Mic\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"14-review\"\>14</span></a> also sees a harsh downgrade in quality from Pebbles The Invisible Girl's last track, the aforementioned \"Doomsday.\" Her vocal performance in this track is harder to enjoy, and DOOM's attempt to \"sing\" at the end of the track, while intentionally poorly done, puts the nail in the coffin for this track.\n\nThis \"singing\" from DOOM also infects the next track, <a href=\"#16\" class=\"review-link\">\"Dead Bent\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"16-review\"\>16</span></a>, and a dissonant vocal sample hurts it further. The album does not end on a low note, however, with tracks like <a href=\"#17\" class=\"review-link\">\"Gas Drawls\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"17-review\"\>17</span></a> and <a href=\"#18\" class=\"review-link\">\"?\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"18-review\"\>18</span></a>. The former is a fairly average track instrumentally, and DOOM gives an above-average vocal performance in his bars on this song.\n\n\"?\" is a fantastic track to end this record off on, with a great performance all-around. DOOM speaks on his late brother, DJ Subroc. This track is reflective and heartfelt, and it ends with the fitting line <em>\"Everything is going according to plan, man.\"</em>\n\nThe rest of this extended record includes original recordings released on 12\" records, extended cuts, and instrumentals. I won't go into hyper-detail here, though these tracks add greatly to this album as an \"origin-story.\" Going straight from KMD's work to this album is a harsh transition, and hearing a younger Dumile in these 12\" cuts fill in these gaps and shows how he grew into this new persona. Hearing DOOM grow and develop his sound is heartwarming and inspiring to hear. We even hear an additional track that was not on the original record in the form of <a href=\"#26\" class=\"review-link\">\"I Hear Voices Pt. 1 - 12\" Version\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"26-review\"\>26</span></a>, with two versions - one in which DOOM is rapping, and one in which MF Grimm gives his own performance over the beat. The instrumental here is peppy and exciting, with bars to match it.\n\nThe 13 instrumentals at the end of the record are great for those who love DOOM for his producing ability as opposed to his rhyming ability. They serve as a great inclusion to this \"Complete\" extended edition.\n\nTo summarize, MF DOOM is clearly still developing his sound on this record, though, despite a few weak cuts, this album is fantastic. It attempts a narrative and shows some of DOOMs best work, instrumentally and lyrically. Disc 2 is a great inclusion, allowing listeners to see how songs, and Dumile himself, developed over time.\n",
