    review: "Daniel Dumile makes his debut under his MF DOOM alias in this lovably rough \"origin story\" of a record.\n\nHe makes use of snippets from the 1982 film Wild Style [Film431] and the 1967-68 Fantastic Four TV Show to juxtapose his past as a member of a graffiti crew turned rap trio KMD [Artist21286] and his future as the super-villain MF DOOM. These skits cover topics like isolationism, publicity, and self-destruction. They fail to create an overarching coherent \"story\" to the album, though they do still add playful interludes that reveal segments of DOOM's backstory, including the reason he wears his iconic mask. The most impactful of these skits is <a href=\"#1\" class=\"review-link\">\"Hero v.s. Villain,\"<span class=\"badge no-underline\" id=\"1-review\"\>1</span></a> in which the listener is challenged to draw the line between good and evil to determine whether MF DOOM is truly the villain he presents himself as.\n\nAs for the actual songs on this record, DOOM never fails to impress with his ability to produce punchy and unconventional beats. His use of samples and collaborators is almost always done masterfully. In the opening track, \"Doomsday\", the inclusion of vocalist Pebbles The Invisible Girl creates infectious hooks - not to mention the rapid-fire, charismatic rhymes on this track. Another catchy track comes in the form of \"Rhymes Like Dimes,\" with an outro from DJ Cucumber Slice that never fails to make me grin.\n\n\"The Finest\" sees a smooth, funk-inspired beat with solid performances in this first collaboration between MF DOOM and Tommy Gunn, though the latter leaves a bit to be desired. \"Go with the Flow\" sees DOOM spitting over an infectious, descending beat in another great cut.\n\nTrack 7, \"Tick, Tick...\" is my least favorite song on this record. The constant tempo changes and dream-like instrumental makes this a hard listen, and the sub-par rhymes on top of it are not enough to save it. While I appreciate the experimentation that went into this track, the end product is a song I will often skip.\n\n\"Red and Gold\" brings the energy back up in with a staccato, disco-like beat that I enjoy thoroughly. \"Who You Think I Am?\" is a massive collaboration track between many of the Monsta Island Czars [Artist47193]. This track is fine - the instrumental isn't anything special, and many of his collaborators pale in comparison to DOOM's ability.\n\n\"Hey!\" serves as one of, if not my favorite track on this record. This track truly shines in its production - it is truly the theme song of a supervillain, and its horns are unbelievably potent. DOOM is at his most evil in this track, and his production here is a highlight.\n\nThe production in \"Operation: Greenbacks\" is stunning as well, though aspects of it tend to drone on and make this track slightly less listenable - namely, its vocal samples. Tommy Gunn doesn't help this with an underwhelming verse. \"The Mic\" also sees a harsh downgrade in quality from Pebbles The Invisible Girl's last track, the aforementioned \"Doomsday.\" Her vocal performance in this track is harder to enjoy, and DOOM's attempt to \"sing\" at the end of the track, while intentionally poorly done, puts the nail in the coffin for this track.\n\nThis \"singing\" from DOOM also infects the next track, Dead Bent, and a dissonant vocal sample hurts it further. The album does not end on a low note, however, with tracks like \"Gas Drawls\" and \"?\". The former is a fairly average track instrumentally, and DOOM gives an above-average vocal performance in his bars on this song.\n\n\"?\" is a fantastic track to end this record off on, with a great performance all-around. DOOM speaks on his late brother, DJ Subroc [Artist1163794]. This track is reflective and heartfelt, and it ends with the fitting line <em>\"Everything is going according to plan, man.\"</em>\n\nThe rest of this extended record includes original recordings released on 12\" records, extended cuts, and instrumentals. I won't go into hyper-detail here, though these tracks add greatly to this album as an \"origin-story.\" Going straight from KMD's work to this album is a harsh transition, and hearing a younger Dumile in these 12\" cuts fill in these gaps and shows how he grew into this new persona. Hearing DOOM grow and develop his sound is heartwarming and inspiring to hear. We even hear an additional track that was not on the original record in the form of \"I Hear Voices,\" with two versions - one in which DOOM is rapping, and one in which MF Grimm gives his own performance over the beat. The instrumental here is peppy and exciting, with bars to match it.\n\nThe 13 instrumentals at the end of the record are great for those who love DOOM for his producing ability as opposed to his rhyming ability. They serve as a great inclusion to this \"Complete\" extended edition.\n\nTo summarize, MF DOOM is clearly still developing his sound on this record, though, despite a few weak cuts, this album is fantastic. It attempts a narrative and shows some of DOOMs best work, instrumentally and lyrically. Disc 2 is a great inclusion, allowing listeners to see how songs, and Dumile himself, developed over time.\n",
